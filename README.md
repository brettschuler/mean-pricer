# MEAN Stack Starter Kit

MEANcore is an open-source boilerplate solution based on the MEAN stack and provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Angular](https://angular.io/) based applications. This project includes modern tools and workflow based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), best practices from the community, a scalable base template and a good learning base.

### Benefits

- Quickstart a project in seconds and focus on features, not on frameworks or tools

- Industrial-grade tools, ready for usage in a continuous integration environment and DevOps

- Scalable architecture with base app template including example components, services and tests

## Before You Begin
Before you begin, it's recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN stack application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* Angular - Angular's [Official Website](https://angular.io/) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

Checkout our blog [Techievor](https://techievor.com) built on meancore for a full rundown on how to setup the MEAN stack with MEANcore:
* [Windows](https://techievor.com/blog/post/2019/02/28/how-to-install-the-mean-stack-on-windows)
* [CentOS](https://techievor.com/blog/post/2019/03/03/how-to-install-the-mean-stack-on-centos)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and create a .env file to setup your environment
```
NODE_ENV='development'
PRODUCTION=false
DOMAIN=
DOMAIN_PATTERN=
HOST_SECURE=
PROXY=

APP_NAME='meancore'
APP_LOGO='assets/images/logo.png'
APP_DEFAULT_ROUTE='home'
APP_BASE_URL='/'
API_BASE_URL='api'
APP_DEFAULT_ROUTE=''
IMAGE_BASE_URL='/image-uploads'
IMAGE_STORAGE='./_content/image-uploads/'
TWITTER_HANDLE=''
MONGO_SEED_LOG_RESULTS=true
META_TITLE_SUFFIX=' | MEANcore'

SESSION_SECRET='MEANCORE'
SESSION_KEY='meancore-key'
SESSION_COLLECTION='meancore-sessions'

GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=''
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=''
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=""
GOOGLE_VIEW_ID=
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=''
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=''

MAILER_FROM='support@meancore.com'
MAILER_SERVICE_PROVIDER=
MAILER_HOST='smtp.ethereal.email'
MAILER_PORT=587
MAILER_USER="username"
MAILER_SECRET="pass"
MAILER_TEST=true
```

2. Next install dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

3. Then launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
 ```bash
 npm run start:dev
 ```

4. Run the MongoDB Seed
To have the default menu feature(s), role(s), and/or user account(s) at runtime:
```bash
npm run seed
```
This will try to seed the features, roles, and users based on the defined NODE_ENV in your env config. You have to copy the user passwords from the console and store it somewhere safe.

5. Running with TLS (Optional)
The application will start by default with the secuire configuration (SSL mode) turned off and listen on port 3000.  To run your application in a secure manner, you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates.  Unix-based users can use the following command:
```bash
npm run generate-ssl-certs
```
Windows users can follow the instructions found [here](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX128656).  After you've generated the key and certificate, ensure they are placed in the config/sslcerts folder.

To enable/disable SSL mode in a production environment, set the HOST_SECURE variable in your env config.

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

Tasks                         | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm run config                | Produces angular environment configuration from .env
npm run version               | Generates version control information based on projects package.json
npm run build:dev             | Lint code and build app for development in `dist/` folder
npm run build:prod            | Lint code and build app for production in `dist/` folder
npm run client:dev            | Run development ng server on `http://localhost:4200/` only
npm run server:dev            | Run development express server only on `http://localhost:3000/`
npm run server:prod           | Run production express server only
npm run start:dev             | Builds client and runs development ng server on `http://localhost:4200/` using proxy config for express endpoints to `http://localhost:3000/`
npm run start:prod            | Builds client for prod and runs production express server
npm run test:client           | Lint code and run unit tests once for continuous integration
npm run lint:client           | Lint client code
npm run lint:server           | Lint server code
npm run e2e                   | Run e2e tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org)
npm run generate-ssl-certs    | Generates self-signed certificates on Unix-based systems using OpenSSL
npm run seed                  | Seeds the database with defaults based on defined configuration


## Development server

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend express configuration.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can also use
`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

If you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,
you can also use the command `ng generate` directly.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

Tasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

# What's in the box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com).
